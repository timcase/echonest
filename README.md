# The Echowrap Ruby Gem
[![Echonest](http://echonest.com/static/img/logos/250x200_dk.gif)](http://developer.echonest.com/index.html)

A Ruby interface to the Echonest API. The Echonest API is based on their
automatically derived-database of about 30 million songs which
is aggregated using web crawling, data mining, and digital signal
processing techniques. The API includes support for music
recommendation, artist recommendation,  playlist generation, acoustic
analysis, music identification, and data feeds. Details about the API
can be found at http://developer.echonest.com/

* This wrapper supports 100% of the [Echonest API Version 4](http://developer.echonest.com/docs/v4)
* Data returned from API calls are mapped into Ruby objects
* Various http clients are supported via [Faraday](https://github.com/lostisland/faraday)
* Uses Unix philosophy of "do one thing and do it well"

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:
```ruby
    gem 'echowrap'
```
And then execute:
```shell
    $ bundle install
```
Or install it yourself as:
```shell
    $ gem install echowrap
```
## Quick Start Guide

First, [get an api key from Echonest][register].

Then copy and paste in your API keys:

```ruby
Echowrap.configure do |config|
  config.api_key =       'YOUR_API_KEY'
  config.consumer_key =  'YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY'
  config.shared_secret = 'YOUR_SHARED_SECRET'
end
```
If you are using Echowrap with a Rails application then a good location
for the key would be to create an initializer, for example you could
place the above code in /config/initializers/echowrap.rb.

You can also use Echowrap in any plain old ruby file and I've included
an example of this
[here](https://github.com/timcase/echowrap/blob/master/examples/echowrap_examples.rb)

You are ready to use Echowrap:

```ruby
Echowrap.song_search(artist: 'Daft Punk')
```
